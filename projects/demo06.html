        <h2>TouchPlow - Snow removal services</h2>
        <h4>UX/UI Designer</h4>
        <div class="h-50"></div>
        <p>I was approached as a freelancer to design this app while still a student at Algonquin College. The app is currently available on Apple and Google stores and can be accessed <a href="https://touchplow.com/" target="_">here.</a>
        <br/>We began the design process with several discovery workshops with the client to collect business goals and requirements.
           His vision was to make this app the "Uber" of snow removal and lawn moving. He wanted to create native apps for both iOS and Android. At the time the app name was "SnowMowz" as it was intended to switch between
            lawn moving and snow plowing services. Later on the name was changed to "TouchPlow".
            <br/>
            <br/>After defining the requirements and two primary personas of the application (the home owner and the service provider), I started defining user journeys and information architecture. During the visual design phase, my focus
           was to adhere to Apple and google design specifications and guidelines for navigation, styles and components. The finished designs were then tested with volunteers that matched our target audience and accordingly changes were implemented.
           <br/><br/> The visual designs presented here are of course <b>very old</b> since they were <b>created in 2015</b> but beleive me they reflected Apple and google interfaces and guidelines at that time. Below are a few example flows.
